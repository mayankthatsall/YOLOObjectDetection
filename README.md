# YOLOObjectDetection
A simple Python program for object detection
OpenCV is used for image processing
I have provided the yolo cfg and COCO Names file that I used for my project
You can customize this code with 2-3 line changes and use if for image,video and webcam
P.S The yolo weights file was too big to upload so you can just refer to this kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/savanagrawal/helmet-detection-yolov3)
